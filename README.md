Estimating the effect of peers on non-cognitive skills of adolescents using friendship networks 
===============================================================================================


Data
----

This research uses data from Add Health, a program project directed by Kathleen Mullan Harris and designed 
by J. Richard Udry, Peter S. Bearman, and Kathleen Mullan Harris at the University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill, and funded by grant P01-HD31921 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child 
Health and Human Development, with cooperative funding from 23 other federal agencies and foundations. 
Special acknowledgment is due to Ronald R. Rindfuss and Barbara Entwisle for assistance in the original 
design. Information on how to obtain the Add Health data files is available on the Add Health Web 
site (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth). No direct support was received from grant P01-HD31921 for 
this analysis

In particular, I use the we use the In-Home and In-School survey for wave 1 along with the wave 1 friendship
nominations data. 


Instructions for using the replication code
-------------------------------------------

1. The master do-file calls all the other do-files and the r-script. Hence, they do not need to be run separately. 
2. The global path directories must be edited according to the user's folder set-up before running the code. 
3. Stata version 16 was used for the analysis
